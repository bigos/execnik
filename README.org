** Usage

*** REPL

Add directory with the project as in the following example

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (push #p "c:/Users/Jacek/Documents/Programming/Lisp/execnik/" asdf:*central-registry*)
  (ql:quickload :execnik)
  (in-package :execnik)
#+END_SRC

*** compilation and running

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sbcl --load ./compilation.lisp
./execnik.exe
#+END_EXAMPLE

On Linux it works in terminal and file managers.

It also works in File Explorer on Windows if you have Msys2 and gtk libraries
installed and ~C:\msys64\mingw64\bin~ path added to your environment variables.

If you do not have the ~mingw64\bin~ path added to your environment you need to
start Msys2 terminal, cd to the executable and start it from the terminal.

Ideal solution would be creation of distributable package similar to:
