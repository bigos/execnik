Add directory with the project as in the following example

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (push #p "c:/Users/Jacek/Documents/Programming/Lisp/execnik/" asdf:*central-registry*)
  (ql:quickload :execnik)
  (in-package :execnik)
#+END_SRC

*** compilation and running

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
sbcl --load ./compilation.lisp
./execnik.exe
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Running on Linux

On Linux it works in terminal and file managers.

**** Runnning on Windows

It also works in File Explorer on Windows if you have Msys2 and gtk libraries
installed and ~C:\msys64\mingw64\bin~ path added to your environment variables.

If you do not have the ~mingw64\bin~ path added to your environment you need to
start Msys2 terminal, cd to the executable and start it from the terminal.

*** Distribution of binary on Windows

---------------------------------------------------

Use my cmdlauncher.cmd a cmd with modified paths to include Mingw64 paths
cd to the project
start execnik.exe to make possible finding of used libraries
start another cmdlauncher and cd to the project
sbcl --load distribution-on-windows.lisp
that creates a new folder with the executable, bundled libraries and other
needed files
